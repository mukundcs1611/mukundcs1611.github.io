## Welcome 

Basic Info about me :
   1. I write terrible code, but I do it everyday hoping I will be better one day (Almost there! Just a light year away)
   2. I have a masters degree in Computers and I dont know how I got that far.

Jokes apart, I did my masters specializing in Artificial Intelligence and Computer Architecture. I have worked in the software industry for a small period of time. I am currently in search of a job. My current interests include- making my code cloud ready , writing software which follows Microservices architecture, getting better in writing prediction algorithms, getting acquainted with Angular4 , D3.js.

I also ,
 1. did a bit of GPU programming using CUDA, Used OpenCV for applying filters on images.
 2. Implemented working models of many machine learning concepts in Matlab and Java
 3. Worked on a super computer (TACC-Stampede) for a parallel programming assignment used MPI for communication between multiple compute instances.
 4.  have an experience of setting up a multi-cluster Hadoop environment and writing distributed code in Java and Python
 5. Know a bit about containers and how they ease deployment of an application.(Has some projects in my github which does it)
