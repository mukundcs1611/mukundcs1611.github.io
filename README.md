## Welcome 

Basic Info about me :
   1. I write terrible code, but I do it everyday hoping I will be better one day (Almost there! Just a light year away)
   2. I have a masters degree in Computers and I dont know how I got that far.

Jokes apart, I did my masters specializing in Artificial Intelligence and Computer Architecture. I have worked for a small period of time. I do code everyday but I don't have a job yet. My current interests include- making my code cloud ready , writing software which follows Microservices architecture, getting better in writing prediction algorithms, getting acquainted with Angular4 , D3.js.

I also ,
 i.  did a bit of GPU programming using CUDA, Used OpenCV for applying filters on images.
 ii.  Got a chance to use a super computer (Stampede) for parallel programming using MPI.
 iii. Implemented working models of many machine learning concepts in Matlab and Java
 iv.  had an experience of setting up a multi-cluster Hadoop environment and writing distributed code in Java and Python


> My interests change very frequently but what is constant is my attitude towards it.
