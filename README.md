## 🛠️ About Me (2017 Edition — The Early Days)

Back in 2017, I was laying the foundation for my tech journey:

- Earned a Master’s in Computer Science, specializing in Artificial Intelligence and Computer Architecture.
- Started hands-on with Java and Selenium, then expanded into Python, Matlab, and early AI/ML projects.
- Explored GPU programming with CUDA and image processing using OpenCV.
- Built and deployed machine learning models in both Matlab and Java.
- Tackled parallel programming assignments on the TACC-Stampede supercomputer, using MPI for distributed computing.
- Set up multi-cluster Hadoop environments and wrote distributed code in Java and Python.
- Began experimenting with containers to streamline application deployment.

These experiences shaped my passion for building scalable, cloud-ready software and set the stage for my growth in microservices, cloud platforms, and AI/ML.
